                                                        ## Building from Source



If you want to build the Crypto and Stock Data Fetcher application from source, follow these steps: Ensure you have the following installed on your system: **Python 3.x**: Download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). **pip**: Python's package installer (usually comes with Python). **PyInstaller**: For creating standalone executables. Open your terminal or command prompt and run: 


git clone https://github.com/King-kin5/Stock.git
cd Stock
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the necessary Python packages:

python -m venv venv          # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate     # Activate on Linux or macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate       # Activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you havenâ€™t installed PyInstaller yet, run:

pip install pyinstaller
Create the executable binary by running:


pyinstaller --onefile crypto.py
This will generate a standalone executable, which can be found in the dist directory after the build process is complete. Navigate to the dist directory and run the binary:


cd dist
# For Linux
./crypto-linux
# For macOS
./crypto-macos
# For Windows
crypto-windows.exe
